## Setting the Stage
Your introduction needs to establish a strong argument (thesis) immediately. Do not just retell the story.

### Key Contextual Factors (AO3)
- **The Jacobean Era:** A patriarchal society where women were expected to be subservient, gentle, and maternal.
- **The Divine Right of Kings:** Plotting regicide was considered a sin against God and nature.
- **The Supernatural:** An audience in 1606 would view Lady Macbeth’s alignment with "spirits" as genuinely terrifying and damnable.

### Suggested Approach
1.  **Hook:** Start with a broad statement about Lady Macbeth's role as a catalyst for the tragedy.
2.  **Thesis:** State clearly how Shakespeare presents her. Is she purely evil, or is she desperate for power she cannot access as a woman?
3.  **Signpost:** Briefly mention the key themes you will cover (Ambition, Gender, Appearance vs Reality).

## The Letter and Immediate Ambition
In this section, analyse Lady Macbeth's first appearance. She reads Macbeth's letter and immediately decides the King must die.

### Key Analysis Points
- **Instant Determination:** Unlike Macbeth, who debates the pros and cons, she accepts the prophecy immediately.
- **Perception of Macbeth:** She fears his nature is too kind. This reveals her own ruthless values.
- **Metaphor:** *"Too full o' th' milk of human kindness"* creates a contrast between "milk" (nurturing, white, innocent) and the "illness" (ambition) she believes is necessary.

### Vocabulary to Use
- **Catalyst:** She triggers the action.
- **Soliloquy:** She reveals her inner thoughts directly to the audience.
- **Subversion:** She overturns expected norms.

## The 'Unsex Me Here' Soliloquy
Lady Macbeth believes her femininity is an obstacle to committing murder. She calls upon dark spirits to remove it.

### Deep Dive: "Unsex Me Here"
- **Imperatives:** She commands the spirits (*"Come"*, *"unsex"*, *"take"*, *"fill"*). This shows immense power and hubris (pride).
- **Body Imagery:** She wants her blood made *"thick"* to stop remorse; she wants her *"milk"* exchanged for *"gall"* (poison/bile).
- **Context (AO3):** By inviting spirits to possess her, she is figuratively becoming a witch. This aligns her with the antagonists of the play and creates a sense of horror.

### Critical Style Tip
Don't just say "she wants to be a man." Argue that she views **remorse** and **conscience** as feminine weaknesses that must be surgically removed.

## The Serpent and the Flower
Lady Macbeth is the master of deception. She instructs Macbeth on how to hide their intent.

### Visual Imagery
- **The Flower:** Innocent, beautiful, passive, natural.
- **The Serpent:** Biblical allusion (Adam and Eve), deadly, hidden, treacherous.

### Controlling the Narrative
When Duncan arrives, Lady Macbeth plays the perfect hostess. This **juxtaposition** between her murderous interior thoughts and her polite exterior behavior highlights her dangerous capacity for deceit.

### Focus Question
How does she coach Macbeth? She treats him almost like a child who cannot hide his emotions, asserting dominance in the relationship.

## Questioning His Masculinity
When Macbeth tries to back out ("We will proceed no further"), Lady Macbeth uses emotional blackmail to force his hand.

### Methods of Manipulation
1.  **Questioning his love:** *"From this time / Such I account thy love."*
2.  **Questioning his manhood:** *"When you durst do it, then you were a man."*
3.  **Violent Imagery:** The image of dashing a baby's brains out.

### Analysis of the "Baby" Image
This is the most shocking moment in Act 1. She takes the ultimate symbol of maternal care (a breastfeeding infant) and destroys it violently. This proves her earlier wish to have her milk turned to gall has worked—she has severed her maternal bond to prove her loyalty to her oath.

## Pragmatism vs. Panic
The murder has happened. Macbeth is distraught, but Lady Macbeth remains practical—or at least appears to.

### A Crack in the Armor?
- *"Had he not resembled / My father as he slept, I had done't."*
- This is a crucial detail. It suggests she is not actually a witch or a monster; she still has human limits.

### Irony
- She tells Macbeth: *"A little water clears us of this deed."*
- This line is deeply ironic considering her sleepwalking in Act 5 (*"Out, damned spot"*). In Act 2, she views the murder as a physical mess to be cleaned, failing to understand the psychological stain of guilt.
- She takes charge, returning the daggers when Macbeth cannot. She is the **practical force** ensuring their safety.

## Synthesising Your Argument
Bring your points together to answer the question: How does Shakespeare present her?

### Summary of Trajectory
- In Acts 1 & 2, she is the **driving force**. Without her, Macbeth likely would not have acted.
- She subverts gender norms, acting with 'masculine' aggression while Macbeth is 'feminine' in his fear.
- However, the cracks (the father reference) hint that her suppression of nature cannot last.

### Final "Big Picture" Thought (AO3)
Shakespeare presents a warning: Lady Macbeth disrupts the Great Chain of Being and the natural order of gender. While she seems powerful now, the audience knows this unnatural power comes at a terrible spiritual cost.
